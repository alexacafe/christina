##inspiration
When we were thinking of ideas for our: javascript, HTML, and CSS projects Lizzy (our teacher) was giving us ideas and when she said we could make a website of inspiring quotes I knew that's what I wanted to make. 

##design
3 weeks ago I took a photography class and some of the photos on my webpage are those!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@_@
For my background I used a picture of kawaii chickens! Because I thought the picture was pretty cute!!!!!!


##code
I coded an array to store all my pictures. I created a button in HTML using a picture of an arrow. When you click on the arrows it calls a fuction in javascript. The fuction moves an index up or down. Then it selects the image at that index from the array and puts it on the screen. If the index reaches the end of the array it loops back to the first image.
